## Changes to Accessibility of Archive of Academic Materials

Over a span of three years, I, along with several other bright students, curated an extensive archive of academic materials, which proved to be a valuable resource for many. However, due to certain university policies, the sharing of some of the materials contained within the archive has now become restricted. Despite several forked repositories that remain available, a substantial portion of the archive has been withdrawn from circulation.

It is worth noting that the decision to limit access to the archive was made in accordance with the university's regulations, which prioritize the protection of intellectual property rights. While sharing academic materials may seem harmless and beneficial to students, it is important to acknowledge the potential legal and ethical implications of such actions. Thus, in order to adhere to the university's policies and maintain a safe and secure academic environment, it was necessary to restrict access to the archive.

I am grateful to have had the opportunity to collaborate with so many talented individuals in curating this archive, and I hope that the restrictions imposed on its accessibility will not detract from its value as a resource for academic enrichment.
